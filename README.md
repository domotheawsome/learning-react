# learningreact

Learning ReactJS for the Sunwize full stack internship.

## What I've created so far:
#### React info page:
This was my first foray into React. From this project, I learned React and JSX syntax, as well as how to style and create components.
#### Airbnb clone:
I've applied my basic React knowledge to create a single page Airbnb clone with dynamic data rendering via mapping data into custom components.
