# learningreact

Learning ReactJS for the Sunwize full stack internship.

Using: https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact

## What I've created so far:
#### React Info Page:
This was my first foray into React. From this project, I learned React and JSX syntax, as well as how to style and create components.
#### Airbnb Clone:
I've applied my basic React knowledge to create a single page Airbnb clone with dynamic data rendering via mapping data into custom components. 
#### Travel Journal:
This was created from scratch using skills from the Airbnb Clone project, styled & polished.
